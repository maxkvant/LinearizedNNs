# LinearizedNNs

Here I apply Neural Tangent Kernel, a new approach to train neural networks.

The repository is inspired by the following paper: [Wide Neural Networks of Any Depth Evolve as Linear Models Under Gradient
Descent.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06720)

## Files

**Wide_NNs_pytorch** - my implementation of wide NNs.


**Resnet18** - my attempt, yet unsuccessful, to achieve 94% accuracy via normal ResNet.
